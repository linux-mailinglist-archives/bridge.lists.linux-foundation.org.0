I'm not sure I understand this, either.

You're saying we should configure the authorizations as de-facto
multicast ATU entries towards all locked ports, so that there wouldn't
be any violation when a station migrates, because the new port is still
in the destination port mask of the ATU entry?

Yes, but... this leaks traffic between ports to a significant degree.
Any packet that targets your printer now targets your colleague's printer too.

I was expecting you'd say that when the cable is unplugged from the
switch, the authorization daemon is notified through rtnetlink of the
link state change, and it flushes the port of addresses it has added
(because the kernel surely does not do this).

This could work to an extent, but it wouldn't handle the case where the
printer isn't connected directly to the 802.1X port, but through
another dumb switch. I don't know enough about 802.1X, but I don't see
why this isn't a valid configuration.

To explain what I'm thinking of. At office, IT gave one Ethernet port to
each desk, but I have multiple devices. I have a PC, a printer, and a
development board, each with a single Ethernet port, so I use a dumb
4-port switch to connect all these devices to the 802.1X port beneath my
desk. I talked to IT, brought my printer to them, they agreed to bypass
802.1X authorization for it based on the MAC address on its label.

I've been working from home for the past few years, but now I need to
return to office. But since years have passed, some colleagues left,
some new colleagues came, and I need to change my desk. The new one
belonged to a co-worker who also had a dumb switch on his desk, so I see
no reason to move mine too. I unplug the printer from my dumb switch,
plug it into the new one, but it doesn't work. What do I do, open a
ticket to IT asking for halp?

To be honest this is purely fictional and I haven't tried it, but it
sounds like I should when I get the chance, to get a better image of how
things are supposed to work.
