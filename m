> Media Redundancy Protocol is a data network protocol standardized by
> International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 62439-2. It allows rings of
> Ethernet switches to overcome any single failure with recovery time faster than
> STP. It is primarily used in Industrial Ethernet applications.
> 
> Based on the previous RFC[1][2][3][4][5], and patches[6][7][8], the MRP state
> machine and all the timers were moved to userspace, except for the timers used
> to generate MRP Test frames.  In this way the userspace doesn't know and should
> not know if the HW or the kernel will generate the MRP Test frames. The
> following changes were added to the bridge to support the MRP:
> - the existing netlink interface was extended with MRP support,
> - allow to detect when a MRP frame was received on a MRP ring port
> - allow MRP instance to forward/terminate MRP frames
> - generate MRP Test frames in case the HW doesn't have support for this
> 
> To be able to offload MRP support to HW, the switchdev API  was extend.

Series applied, thank you.
