The code works, but I think that we should "undisaster" it. :)

That was my first thought too, but the way the flags are handled with
the mask etc, does so that
mv88e6xxx_port_set_lock() is called when other flags change. It could
be done by the transition
from locked->unlocked by checking if the port is locked already.
On the other hand, the timers will timeout and the entries will be
removed anyhow.

Yes, of course.

I will have to look into that, but I think they all do support these features.

It is of course needed to read the fid and I couldn't really
understand the reasoning behind how it was before,
but I will do as you say as best I can.

I don't know about the naming of this define (I probably overlooked
the 6352 part), but it is the same as I have in the
spec for 6097, and I don't see any alternative...

As I remember it was because mv88e6xxx_atu_locked_entry_flush() was called both
with and without the lock, but there was something I didn't know about
how link down
handling works.

Hmm, my experience tells me that much is opposite the normal
conventions when dealing with
locked ports, as there was never switchdev notifications from the
driver to the bridge before, but
that is needed to keep ATU and FDB entries in sync.

I think that approach should be sufficient too.

Just a small optimization as I also have another case of the switch
(only one switch case if
you didn't notice) belonging to the next patch set regarding dynamic
ATU entries.

I guess you are right that when setting the port STP state to BLOCKED, there is
the potential race you mention.

Of course.

Right!

Yes. I think I got that idea from some other driver, thus avoiding
switchdev.h file,
but I will change it.

OK

As I am calling the function in if statement checks, it would make
that code more messy, while with
this approach the function can be called from anywhere. I also looked
at having two functions, with
one being a wrapper function taking the lock and calling the other...

Again the wish to be able to call it from if statement checks,.

They are according to the Linux kernel coding standard wrt indentation afaik.
