In the current implementation (patch v3) this is done here:
https://github.com/microchip-ung/mrp/blob/patch-v3/kernel-patches/v3-0009-net-bridge-mrp-Integrate-MRP-into-the-bridge.patch#L112

We simply ask the bridge not to forward any MRP frames, on MRP enabled
ports, and let "someone" else do that.

I understand the motivation of using the existing forwarding mechanism,
but I do not think we have all the hooks needed. But we can certainly
limit the impact on the existing code as much as possible.

Seems to work fine :-D

Based on this, and also on the input from JÃ¼rgen, I think there is a
good chnage we can make this work for existing silicon from several
vendors.

Yes, but the issues in using the MDB API for this is that it does not
allow to look at source ports, and it does not allow to update the
priority of the frames.

Sounds good - I will try to explain and illustrate this a bit better,
such that we all have the same understanding of the problem we need to
solve.
